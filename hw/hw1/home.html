           <strong>What are Programing Languages</strong><br />
            <p> Computer programming languages allow us to give instructions to a computer in a language the computer understands. </p>
            <p> The portion of the language that a computer can understand is called a "binary".</p>
            <p> Translating programming language into binary is known as “compiling.”  </p>
            <p> These languages allow computers to quickly and efficiently process large and complex swaths of information.</p>

            C++
           <br>C++ is a general purpose, object-oriented, middle-level programming language and is an extension of C language, which makes it possible to code C++ in a “C style”. In some situations, coding can be done in either format, making C++ an example of a hybrid language.

            Java
           <br>Java is a general-purpose, object-oriented, high-level programming language with several features that make it ideal for web-based development.

            Python
            <br>Python is an advanced programming language that is interpreted, object-oriented and built on flexible and robust semantics.
